mostly because you know

even better than i do

how it ends

but for now let us lie

you on your back on the bench

knees bent to nothing

and one hand to stop the whole sun

and me on the ground with my head by your feet

my back is straight and i'm trying

to read        but even in the corner

of my eye you take up too much of me
