Come morning, there's no rain but the promise of rain 

in the sky and in the body. I've done you bad damage

and don't yet know it, except in the slant of my nervous

hands when sometimes I remember to see them.



All night we didn't touch one another, only once

you put your hands to me and I to you like good 

children examining wrapped gifts. You said, "you're so

<em>different</em> from me," and what I felt then--

that the home one loves in longing for home 

is entirely other than that which I can make you-- 

was the same as what I'd learn too slowly later.

The clarity was sweet, then cool, then passed.

It got late. In my room, we built a place

I'd never been before, where it seemed safe to ask

some precipitous questions: faith, but not death; death,

but not bodies; bodies, but never our own. I remember 

everything as dimly lit and blue, though I can't think

why that would have been—the moon? Then the surface

of the present like a rung bell humming, then silence,

then how silence saturates the space between lovers or friends 

or other fragile arrangements of bodies trying carefully

to know one another; for such little space

there is so much color: cobalt, halo, almond, hail, 

lashes, whites, stillness I did not take

for bracing, not for weeks.
