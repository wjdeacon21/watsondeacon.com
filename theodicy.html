While the adults were discussing evil in the kitchen, 

my parents opposite the atheists, 

 

I considered my father, whose face, 

he'd said, his father ground  

into the linoleum over spilled soup— 

 

a revelation, dropped almost on accident and followed 

with some joke. And Aunt Marnie, the half-sister, 

said she'd been made to call another woman mother, a fact 

that seemed worth storing immediately, although 

it's only lately come to scare me. I kept 

 

naming what I couldn't stand <em>evil</em> and drifting 

through the light gauzy dust of the rest. 

For example, I wrote <em>I hate you</em> a hundred times 

on a notecard—I can't remember over what. 

I can't believe that everything is level. 

 

My father says it had to be this way: love 

is not a gift but a giving, not a once 

but an always, and risks such a long dark turn away. 

 

I look across the island at my mother and ask a vicious question,  

the notecard burns in my pocket, she says honey of course not,  

God is forgiving, of course I do not think that, how could you even ask?
