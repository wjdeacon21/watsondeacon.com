<em>Everything</em> meant  

<em>never</em> and <em>always</em> were the same  

bird, two doves, the way  

 

<em>wound</em> is just a shape and holds 

two words: what the cloth had done around  

the body and what the body suffered. 

If you have kept your promise this morning,  

you, too, have practiced resurrection. 

 

Days passed—when at last I begged 

for a sign to know the end of all things 

beginning, I meant waking so 

often in the dark had left me small 

and faithless, afraid of waiting.  

 

The room feels thin and changes and if 

what's broken in can speak it keeps silent. I've never said 

the same word twice, not even in prayer, is that not faith? 

I'll tell you this: being heard feels like a miracle. 

I sit as still as I can. Then there's <em>everything</em> sounding 

out clearly but softly and not quite in language—sit with me, listen.
